        Hi everyone! My name is Hexi Wang (feel free to call me Wendy), and I’m a rising senior at Great Neck South High School, NY. I decided to take this class because I wanted to explore more in the computer science area beyond the programming courses I took in high school. I’m interested in doing projects to practice the coding language; it brings me so much satisfaction after I complete the project without any errors. Outside of school, I’m a huge fan of animals, although I don’t have one currently. I like trying new things and exploring different foods.
        Something probably special about me is that I’m an international student who came to the US three years ago. I hope I can make new friends with different backgrounds during these two weeks!
