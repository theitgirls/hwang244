        <p>
            Hi everyone! My name is <strong>Hexi Wang</strong> (feel free to call me <strong>Wendy</strong>), and I’m a rising senior at Great Neck South High School, NY. 
            I decided to take this class because I wanted to explore more in the computer science area beyond the programming courses I took in high school. 
            I’m interested in doing projects to practice the coding language; it brings me so much satisfaction after I complete the project without any errors. 
            Outside of school, I’m a huge fan of animals, although I don’t have one currently. I like trying new things and exploring different foods.
        </p>
        <h2>Personal Experience</h2>
        <p>Something probably special about me is that I’m an international student who came to the US three years ago. 
            I hope I can make new friends with different backgrounds during these two weeks!
        </p>
